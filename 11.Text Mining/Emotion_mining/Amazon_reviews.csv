Good RAM and ROM (4/64GB) with RAM plus where part of ROM would act as RAM2. Good battery capacity of 5000mAH2. Phone is slightly bigger than other brands like M213.

7,3.0,Overall OK-OK,"Had this phone for about 2-3 day and here is my review:1) Body-wise, the phone is bit heavy but looks classy. - 4/52) Battery life also seems fine at the moment. - 3.5/53) The UI is same as other Samsung Galaxy M smartphones which is smooth and clutter free. - 4/54) The screen is big enough and features vibrant colors. - 4/55) Performance seems fine (not excellent btw) when using multiple apps. I haven't tested big games though. - 3.5/56) The worst part of this phone is its camera quality. I expected much better quality pics from dual 13 MP rear camera. - 2/5Final Verdict: Decent entry level smartphone from usability and performance standpoint. Avoid if camera quality is big concern for you.",18 April 2023
